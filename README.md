This is a simple digital clock website which showcases the learning I went through a tutorial project and implementing that.

I decided to try making the project from scratch by looking at the final result that the particular YouTuber was attempting to run through the code for and then trying to get a close enough solution.
In the end I managed to successfully complete it with my own styling as well with the colour scheme used in the website UI.
